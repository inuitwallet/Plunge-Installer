Utility to build the Windows Installer for plunge
Written in AutoHotkey (http://ahkscript.org/)

1) edit the file paths in "gen_includes.ahk" to point to your local plunge repo
2) run "gen_includes.ahk". This will generate two files, "create_plunge_dirs.ahk" and "install_plunge_files.ahk"
3) compile the "plunge runner.ahk" file using nu.ico as the icon
4) compile the "plunge installer.ahk" file also using nu.ico as the icon
